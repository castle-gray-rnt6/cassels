This repository is associated to the paper "The exceptional set in Cassels's theorem on small cyclotomic integers" by Jitendra Bajpai, Srijan Das, Kiran S. Kedlaya, Nam H. Le, Meghan Lee, Antoine Leudi√®re, and Jorge Mello.

The folder `Rust` contains a Rust program `cassels` (built with version 1.89) to perform an exhaustive search for cyclotomic integers with small castle, as cited in Lemma 3.11. It has its own README.

The following Jupyter notebooks use the SageMath kernel (tested using version 10.6):

- `check-table-1.ipynb`: Verify that the output of the Rust code is consistent with Table 1. Cited in Lemma 3.11.
- `combinatorics.ipynb`: Check some assertions about difference sets of some finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Cited in Lemma 5.1, Lemma 5.2, and Lemma 5.3.
- `corollary-4.5.ipynb`: Use cyclotomic hashes to compare values produced by Theorem 1 with Robinson's Conjecture 1. Cited in Corollary 4.5.
- `floating-point.ipynb`: Verify the numerical accuracy of the floating-point approximations of sines and cosines used in the Rust code. Cited in Lemma 3.11.

These notebooks in turn depend on the following SageMath code files:

- `create-table.sage`: Create a data structure reflecting Table 1. This code also verifies a claim about minimal levels made in Remark 3.3.
- `parse_cyclotomic_integer_exponents.sage`: Parse the output of the Rust code (see below) to generate cyclotomic integers in SageMath.
- `utils.sage`: Implement various utility functions described in section 3.
